            <p>I have a passion for the power of the webâ€”the way that it connects and empowers people all over the world. As a writer and editor with 20 years of experience, I'm passionate about understanding people, sharing knowledge, and the ways the web helps people engage brands, ideas, and each other.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I enjoy hiking with my family and watching pretty much any movie. I lived in Mizusawa in northern Japan for three years, where I played taiko drums with a local group, tried waterfall meditation, and plunked 100-yen coins into UFO Catchers at the local arcade.</p>
            <p>I'm an avid reader, with a nightstand full of books. The last book I read that I'd recommend was <em>Caging Skies</em> by Christine Leunens.</p>
